# 💾A Python ECU Project 

## [+] About Project:
     main route is creating a ECU for an imaginary Engine
 ## --Right now Planning is still going on,
# but here is a short explanation:

## Firts of All

 - ### [What is ECU] 🕹️
    + #### Long Explanation : [ECU Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_control_unit)

    + Short Explanation : ECU(Electronic Control Unit) is a Electro board that thinks and plans about your vehicle's engine's next move for you

 - ### [Why am i doing this]✨
    + I dont know but it is just an urge to do it
    + I can expand my 'Python' knowledge with this project
    + I want to achive something big even though if it is pointless
    + If i can make it someone might need it one day
    + I luv Nissan Skyline R-34 and i want to create its haritage by myself

 - ### [What do i need in this 'Process' to make more progressive movement] 📐
    + 🚧 Information of 'Fluids used by Average Engine'
    + 🚧 What does an engine ECU is planning
    + 🚧 How an Engine Mechanism Works like
    + 🚧 Might need an Blueprint of Engine parts so i can sort parts by their required 'work' fields
    + 🚧 How to route Fluids to 'Usage of Need' by engine parts
 
 - ### [Do i have a deadline] 📆
    + No , just like rome wasn't built in one day, this project's timeline is not going set finish-line in a month or week it is going to take long due to changes in my life
